The Waterfall Model:

With the waterfall method, software is developed from scratch and, therefore, the model needs to be concrete and provide a clear view of tasks from beginning to end. The waterfall method works by fully completing one software unit and then moving on the the next component. To avoid waisting time by designing a system that doesn't meet the software requirements, the requirements and software design have to be solid in order to solve the problem efficiently. 

Requirements and Definition: 
The requirements of the system are the overall function of the program. 
If the requirements are not clear or are incorrect, there is no purpose of the system.
The first step is the time to define functions, constraints and any system specifications that need to be met.
In terms of the Course User Registration Software Emulartor (CURSE), there has to be correct registration numbers, class times, assigned professors, and available seats. 
There must be different users such as students, professors, and an admin who should be able to access the database.
The students should be able to register for classes if the correct constraints are met.
Each user must have different permissions as a professor should not be able to register for classes and students should not be able to see the roster.
Constraints can be more technical as a user should be given a user interface and the database should be readable 

System and Software Design: 
Once a solid list of requirements and constraints is established, the next step is to actually develop the architecture and components of the system.
When designing a system like CURSE, there needs to be solid architecture in order for the system to not fail.
With so much traffic at one time, the system must be able to handle or distribute the load so that the system will not crash. 

Implementation and Unit Testing: 
Once the architecture and other components are established, the next step is to implement the functionality into the system.
This will implement the technical aspects of the requirements and definition portion of the model.
The software for a user interface and the software for the functionality of CURSE should be developed according to the constraints set.
Once the code is written, the programmer is expecting to be able to have a student register for a class. To follow the waterfall method, each individual software unit would have to be finished before moving on to the next unit but this system has connected parts, which requires some overlap of development. Testing must be done to see if the bare minimum is correct.
For example, a user should be able to login, a user should have proper credentials, and the database should be displaying correctly.

Integration and System Testing: 
While the functionality of the program might be working, there are most likely flaws in the system.
This is where the system as a whole should be tested. A student must be able to at least register for a class.
If these works, constraints and stipulations should be added.
If there are no seats available in the class, a student should not be able to register for that particular class.
If a student does not have the prerequisites required for the class, the student should not be able to register.
This should also include tests for the system architecture.
There will be a large number of users signing in at the same time and attempting to register at the same time.
A good test would be to simulate a registration with a large amount of users to see if the program will be able to handle the load.

Operation and maintenance: 
While the system may seem bulletproof, everything will eventually break and there must be maintenance performed by the admin.
Some common bugs could include failure at logging in, failure of registering for a class, failure of viewing the courses correctly, and failing because the website crashed. Over time the requirements of the system may evolve as well. The software may become popular and require a larger database, or different functionality may need to be added. If these events occur, they will be addressed with by restarting the waterfall development process.
